## Running the project
1. Because we use django, to run the project code you must follow the instructions below. First open up a Windows command line terminal (cmd). 
2. Navigate to the main folder where you saved and unzipped the code for BrewRu. This will be the first "BrewRu" folder, not the second one.
3. Run "python manage.py runserver" from command line
4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000 in web browser
5. You should now see the website in the browser window.
